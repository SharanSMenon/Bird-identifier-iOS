#  Privacy Policy

We do not collect, save, or use any of your personal data in North American Bird Identifier.

You might be asked to give access to your photo library or camera. This is so that the model can identify your bird. These images are stored on your device and are not collected. Pictures uploaded to the app are never sent over the internet and all processing is done on device. Saved observations are stored on device. We cannot access/save any observations you have saved, and they will never leave your device.

The model identifies birds offline, regardless of internet connectivity. The only internet request this app makes is to the iNaturalist API to fetch details about the taxon. No pictures or any sort of personal data are sent to the API and the API does not collect any personal data or photos. 

We do not access/use the location data saved in any of your images, whether it was taken by camera or uploaded from your photo library.
